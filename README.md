**muster** (`@garrison-hq/muster`) is a conformance harness for the
**agent-file stack** — the growing set of plain-text files that define how an
AI agent behaves. A modern agent isn't one persona file; it's a persona, a set
of skills, a standard-operating-procedure, a tool manifest, a memory store, a
heartbeat checklist, and an inter-agent card — each with its own emerging spec.
muster checks every one of them, two ways:

- **The files** — parse each document, validate it against its spec, resolve
  composition to a byte-stable canonical form, and report every violation by
  path and section. Fully offline and deterministic.
- **The model** — grade a bring-your-own model against what each file *declares*
  (persona axes, skill triggers, SOP rules, tool selection, memory recall,
  heartbeat actions, A2A skills) over real conversations, against any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

It started as the reference **CTS-1** harness for
[Soul.md RFC-1](https://github.com/rokoss21/soul.md) and grew a spec-agnostic
core that now drives **seven conformance layers plus cross-layer composition.**

📖 **Full documentation: [garrison-hq.github.io/muster](https://garrison-hq.github.io/muster)**

## The layers

Each layer has a **static** mode (offline, deterministic, byte-stable) and most
add a **behavioral** mode (grade a live model). Static always runs; behavioral
runs only when an endpoint is configured, and is skipped gracefully otherwise.

| Layer | File / spec | What muster checks | Command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Persona** | `Soul.md` — [Soul.md RFC-1](https://github.com/rokoss21/soul.md) / CTS-1 | RFC-1 schema, §25 rules, composition (extends / mixins / profiles / dynamic state) → canonical form; behavioral verbosity / refusal / state-shift axes | `check`, `resolve`, `cts run`, `behave run` |
| **Skills** | `SKILL.md` — [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) | frontmatter, directory layout, bundled-file safety; behavioral trigger-routing | `skills run` |
| **SOP** | `AGENTS.md` — OpenClaw SOP | rule-text presence, precedence definition, tool drift; behavioral compliance + adversarial probes | `sop run` |
| **Tools** | `TOOLS.md` | manifest lint, environment drift; behavioral tool-selection | `tools run` |
| **Memory** | `MEMORY.md` / `USER.md` | staleness + contradiction lint; behavioral recall + privacy/leak probes | `memory run` |
| **Heartbeat** | `HEARTBEAT.md` | static lint + interval-config checks; behavioral action-diff / idempotency / quiet-ack | `heartbeat run` |
| **A2A** | Agent Card (JSON) — Agent-to-Agent | card schema + offline signature lint; live skill-behavior / auth-negative / signed-card conformance | `a2a run` |
| **Cross-layer** | composition of the above | precedence, contradiction, and **rule survival** across a full layer stack | `crosslayer run` |

## Install

Requires Node ≥ 22.

```bash
# As a CLI tool
npm install -g @garrison-hq/muster
muster --help
```

Or run from source with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garrison-hq/muster.git && cd muster
pnpm install
pnpm build          # tsc (strict) + schema copy → dist/
pnpm test           # vitest: the full offline suite (unit + CTS + adapters)
```

From a source checkout, run the CLI with `node dist/cli/index.js …` or
`pnpm dev …` instead of the global `muster` binary.

## Quickstart

Every command shares two global flags — `--mode <strict|permissive>` (default
`strict`) and `--json` — and a uniform exit-code contract: `0` conforming / all
passed, `1` violations / ≥ 1 case failed, `2` execution error (unreadable or
invalid manifest).

The package ships a runnable [`examples/`](./examples) directory with one
self-contained example per layer. Run them from the repository (or installed
package) root:

```bash
# Persona — static conformance of one document (§25.1 report; never touches the network)
muster check examples/soul/Soul.md --json

# Persona — effective configuration after full §7.5 resolution
# (canonical-json = byte-stable RFC 8785, the CTS-1 comparison form)
muster resolve examples/soul/Soul.md --output-format canonical-json

# Persona — the CTS-1 static fixture suite (Appendix F manifest)
muster cts run examples/cts/manifest.yaml

# Skills — lint SKILL.md frontmatter, layout, and bundled-file safety
muster skills run examples/skills/manifest.yaml

# SOP — lint AGENTS.md rule-text presence, precedence, and tool drift
muster sop run examples/sop/manifest.yaml

# Tools — lint a TOOLS.md manifest and check it against the environment
muster tools run examples/tools/manifest.json

# Memory — lint MEMORY.md / USER.md for staleness and contradiction
muster memory run examples/memory/manifest.json

# Heartbeat — lint HEARTBEAT.md and its interval configuration
muster heartbeat run examples/heartbeat/manifest.json

# A2A — lint an Agent Card and verify its signature offline
muster a2a run examples/a2a/manifest.json

# Cross-layer — check composition / precedence / rule-survival across a stack
muster crosslayer run examples/crosslayer/manifest.yaml
```

See [`examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md) for the full table.

### Behavioral mode (bring your own model)

The static commands above are fully offline. To grade a live model, point a
layer at any OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint — local Ollama,
NVIDIA NIM, OpenAI, anything:

```bash
# Persona axes, k-of-n graded over multi-turn conversations
muster behave run examples/behave/manifest.yaml --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 --model gpt-4o

# Adapter behavioral cases switch on via environment variables
MUSTER_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1 muster heartbeat run examples/heartbeat/manifest.json
MUSTER_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1 muster crosslayer run examples/crosslayer/manifest.yaml
MUSTER_A2A_ENDPOINT=https://my-agent.example.com muster a2a run examples/a2a/manifest.json
```

| Layer | Endpoint variable(s) | Model variable | Default model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `behave` | `--base-url` / manifest `base_url` | `--model` / manifest `model` | (manifest) |
| `memory` | `--base-url` (with `--behavioral`) | `--model` | `llama3.2` |
| `heartbeat`, `crosslayer` | `MUSTER_ENDPOINT` | `MUSTER_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `a2a` | `MUSTER_A2A_ENDPOINT` (+ `MUSTER_A2A_TOKEN`) | — | — |

The API key is read from `MUSTER_API_KEY` (fallback `OPENAI_API_KEY`) at request
time — and A2A from its own isolated namespace. There is deliberately **no key
flag, no key file, and no key field in any manifest**; manifests carry only the
*name* of the environment variable, never the value. Keys must never be
committed (a repository invariant test enforces this).

## Documentation

The deep material lives on the docs site:

- **[Getting started](https://garrison-hq.github.io/muster/getting-started/)** — install and first checks.
- **[Static conformance](https://garrison-hq.github.io/muster/guides/static-conformance/)** — the parse → validate → resolve → report pipeline.
- **[Behavioral conformance](https://garrison-hq.github.io/muster/guides/behavioral-conformance/)** — the axes, k-of-n grading, and BYOM endpoints.
- **[Reference resolution](https://garrison-hq.github.io/muster/guides/reference-resolution/)** — supported schemes, the `--restrict-refs` flag, and the trust model (RFC-1 §7.2).
- **[CLI reference](https://garrison-hq.github.io/muster/reference/cli/)** — every command and flag.
- **[CTS-1 coverage](https://garrison-hq.github.io/muster/reference/cts-1-coverage/)** — how the fixtures map onto the nine §25.2 categories.
- **[Architecture](https://garrison-hq.github.io/muster/reference/architecture/)** — the spec-agnostic core and the adapters.

## How it was built

muster was built with a spec-driven, multi-agent workflow; the complete trail
for every layer — specification, plan, work-package tasks, acceptance matrices,
and post-merge mission reviews — is preserved under
[`kitty-specs/`](./kitty-specs), alongside the Claude Code agent definitions and
mission orchestration under [`.claude/`](./.claude), as a worked example of the
methodology. The normative Soul.md RFC-1 text is vendored at
`.kittify/reference/soul-spec.md` (see [`NOTICE`](./NOTICE) for its attribution;
it remains the property of its upstream author) and is the single source of
truth for every RFC-1 check — each test cites the section it enforces.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. The one rule that matters most: **every conformance
behavior traces to a section of the spec it enforces**, cited in the code and
the test name. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the architecture
invariants (spec-agnostic core, the core↔adapter boundary, determinism, no
baked-in providers, minimal dependencies) and the PR checklist. By participating
you agree to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
